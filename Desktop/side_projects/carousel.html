      <h5>Ruby/Rails, Postgres, HTML, CSS</h5></center>
      <p>This project is a message board site created with a postgreSQL database using Ruby on Rails. The idea for the app originated with my dad,
      who passed away this year unexpectedly. I wanted a place for me and my siblings to be able to post memories and celebrate all of the good
      times we had with my father. His name, 'Dan', also served as inspiration for the name of the site.</p>
      <p>Feel free to play around with my app more <a href="https://danipedia.herokuapp.com/posts">here.</a></p>

      <h5>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</h5></center>
      <p>A simple classic! This is a basic memory game where you flip tiles over, trying
      to find a matching pair.</p>

    <center><h3>Stevens Academy</h3>
      <h5>HTML & CSS</h5></center>
      <p>This was a site I redesigned for a local Raleigh school. Their original site, which you can see <a href="http://www.stevensprepacademy.com/">here</a>
      was dark, somewhat cluttered, and very outdated. My goal was to develop a clean, navigable site that was bright and inviting.</p>
      <p>As a kid I always thought I would grow up to be an artist, and when I get to spend time really diving in deep with the design aspects of a site
      I feel like I am living out that childhood goal in a way. You can play with that site more <a href="http://www.joytaylorkaufman.com/stevens_academy">here</a></p>

      <h3>Tic Tac Toe</h3>
      <h5>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</h5></center>
      <p>A simple classic! Tic tac toe made using an array of arrays for the JavaScript game logic. This was originally a class project that I ended up
      revisiting to keep my JS knowledge from getting rusty!</p><p>When I first tried making this app my knowledge of JavaScript was so rudimentary! It was a
      lot of fun coming back to it with a bit more experience.</p>

      <h3>Lady Dev</h3>
      <h5>HTML, CSS, Wordpress, PHP, mySQL</h5></center>
      <p>This is an ongoing project. I'm teaching myself PHP on a MAMP db structure to gut this layout and recreate my own.</p><p>My PHP skills aren't<td>
      as good as I'd like yet though, so I'm leaning on a theme for the short term.</p><p>This mission of Lady Dev is going to be providing resources for women
      in technology, or considering careers in a technical field. You can look at it more <a href="http://ladydevblog.wordpress.com">here</a></p>
